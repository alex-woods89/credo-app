# credo-app

First step is to get the api running and database seeded.

I wasn't sure how to make the files executable on windows however it is straight forward to get everything running through an IDE(i'd recommend using IntelliJ)

navigate into credo_server and find the CredosoftApplication.java file. run the public class CredosoftApplication to get the server running and seeded.
this will default to localhost 8080

next step is to get the front end running.

navigate into credo_client, npm i to install the dependencies once this is done npm start and the server should start on local host 3000 and automatically open a window so you can use the app
